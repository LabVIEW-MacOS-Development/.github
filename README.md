## What is LabVIEW for Mac?

LabVIEW for Mac is a **comprehensive graphical development environment** created by National Instruments (NI) for engineers and scientists. It specializes in building systems for data acquisition, instrument control, industrial automation, and embedded monitoring. Its unique dataflow programming model uses intuitive graphical block diagrams instead of traditional text-based code, accelerating the design of complex applications.

The software is optimized for performance on **macOS Ventura, Monterey, and Sonoma**, running natively on both Intel-based Macs and Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3). It offers extensive libraries for hardware integration, advanced data analysis, and visualization tools, making it an indispensable tool for research, validation, and production testing across various industries.
